## Description

This is an implementation and consumtion of a generic networking layer that can be used to request raw and typed data from any REST API.
In this example app I used this Network package to integrate with the SportMonks API, which returns football data as well as other sports like Cricket and Formula 1.

The app is still work in progress.


## Built with:
- SwiftUI
- Combine
- Asynchronous (async/await) Functions
